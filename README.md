# WeatherScript
A Short Weather Report Using Shell Script Commands

This is a relatively short script written in Shell that allows a user to enter a desired location and temperature measurement system (either Celsius or Fahrenheit), and receive a short weather report that extracts data from the OpenWeatherMap API in response. In addition, if the user chooses to receive their report in Fahrenheit, then they will also receive an email with a clothing recommendation for the day at an email address of their choosing. A tutorial detailing the development / thought process behind many sections of the script has been written in comments throughout the script.

Please Note: In order to execute the script, you must first enter a valid API key and email at the specified locations (lines 34, 35).

For more information on OpenWeatherMap API and to sign up for an API key, please visit: https://openweathermap.org/api
